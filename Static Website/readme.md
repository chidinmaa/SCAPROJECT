### HOW TO CREATE A STATIC WEBSITE IN S3 BUCKET
- Navigate to s3 in your aws,to create an s3 bucket.s3 is a bucket storage and the data stored in an s3 is called an object.
- In my previous project,I showed you how to create a bucket through CLI.Now i will be showing you how to create a bucket through the management console. In the left navigation pane, choose Buckets.
- Choose Create bucket.

- The Create bucket page opens.

- Under General configuration, view the AWS Region where your bucket will be created.

- Under Bucket type, choose General purpose.

- For Bucket name, enter a name for your bucket.

- The bucket name must have a unique name.Be between 3 and 63 characters long. Consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-). For best compatibility, we recommend that you avoid using dots (.) in bucket names, except for buckets that are used only for static website hosting. Begin and end with a letter or number.

- I created a bucket called "chidi.scalagos"

- Go to properties of the bucket you created and enable static website hosting.

- copy the bucket website endpoint and paste it in your browser. http://chidi.scalagos.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

- It will bring out a 403 error.

- In permissions edit the block all public access and untick and save. This will enable the public to access your object in your object.

- paste in the bucket policy.
